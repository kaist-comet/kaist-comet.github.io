  title: "Traveling Salesman Problem with Backend Information Processing"
  journal: "Operations Research Letters"
  volume: "57"
  pages: "107213"
  doi: "10.1016/j.orl.2024.107193"
  abstract: "This paper introduces the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with Backend Information Processing (bTSP), which integrates backend processing times into path planning to minimize the makespan. The study develops a mixed integer linear programming formulation and conducts a theoretical analysis to understand the relationship between the TSP and the bTSP. The results show that an optimal solution for the bTSP can be efficiently derived by leveraging the connection to the standard TSP."

  title: "Supervised Optimization Framework for Charging and Discharging Controls of Battery Energy Storage"
  journal: "IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid"
  volume: "15"
  issue: "6"
  pages: "5610-5621"
  doi: "10.1109/TSG.2024.3416369"
  abstract: "Although residential houses have widely adopted battery energy storage (BES) in conjunction with solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, it has been challenging to optimize BES controls owing to the uncertainty inherent in electricity prices, renewable energy resources, and electricity demand loads. The main objective of this study is to propose a supervised optimization (SO) framework designed to enable supervised learning to infer efficient BES operations in conjunction with mathematical optimization. Based on the proposed SO framework, a mathematical optimization model is formulated and solved to generate optimal charging and discharging controls given historical data in an offline optimization fashion. Then, a supervised learning model can be trained based on the optimal charging and discharging controls to infer efficient BES charging and discharging controls in an online optimization fashion. Specifically, an objective function and constraints driven by the mathematical optimization model are reflected in the course of training and inferring by supervised learning models so that the SO framework can infer feasible and efficient BES controls. Numerical experiments are conducted with data collected from a residential community in Texas, and the results reveal that the proposed SO framework results in better performance compared to the benchmark model, such as reinforcement learning and model predictive control."

  title: "Graph Partitioning-based Matheuristic for Residential Waste Collection Problem with Visual Attractiveness and Turn Penalty"
  journal: "European Journal of Operational Research"
  volume: ""

  doi: "10.1016/j.ejor.2025.11.035"
  abstract: "The residential waste collection problem is a variant of the arc routing problem in which vehicles collect household waste along streets and transport it to landfills. In practice, drivers and planners prefer routes that are easy to follow, clearly separated, and visually coherent, whereas cost-minimizing solutions often yield unintuitive routes. To bridge this, the concept of visual attractiveness (VA) has been studied to evaluate how compact, non-overlapping, and connected routing solutions are. This study extends VA by introducing the arc overlapping index (AOI), which quantifies residents’ dissatisfaction from repeated vehicle visits. We propose a mixed integer linear programming model that jointly minimizes AOI and turn-penalty-aware route costs, accounting for the turning delays of heavy garbage trucks often ignored in previous studies. To efficiently generate visually attractive solutions that capture the separability of road networks (e.g., bridges and tunnels), we develop a graph partitioning-based matheuristic. Graph partitioning divides a network into balanced subgraphs while minimizing edge cuts but has rarely been applied to routing problems, which typically assume complete graphs. Our approach leverages both graph-structural and spatial information to produce compact, non-overlapping, and capacity-feasible clusters, whose routes are then optimized using the proposed mathematical model. Computational experiments on 31 road-network clustering instances with up to 2400 nodes and 3000 edges show that our method is 120-times faster than baseline algorithms for capacitated clustering on average, while yielding higher connectivity and less overlap. On 100 routing instances, our method achieves a 6.0 % route-cost reduction and outperforms previous approaches across all VA metrics."
